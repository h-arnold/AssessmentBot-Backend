# Stage 5 Code Review

This document provides a detailed review of the implementation for Stage 5 of the Assessment Bot backend. The review covers code quality, test coverage, documentation, and adherence to project standards.

## Overall Assessment

The implementation is in a good state and all major requirements of the TODO list have been met. The code is well-structured, and the tests provide a good level of confidence in the functionality. However, there are several areas where the implementation can be improved to meet the project's high standards for quality and rigour.

## Outstanding Tasks

The following tasks from the `TODO.md` are not yet complete or require further attention:

- [x] **DTO and Validation**:
  - [x] Add a specific test case for mixed types within the `IMAGE` task type (e.g., `reference` is a string, but `template` is a Buffer). (Verified complete)
  - [x] Add an explicit test for base64 strings in the `IMAGE` task type payload. (Verified complete)
- [ ] **Verification & Smoke Testing**:
  - [ ] Run `npm run verify:assessor` and ensure all tests pass. The script exists but there is no evidence of it being run.
- [ ] **Documentation**:
  - [ ] Update `docs/ImplementationPlan/Stage5/TestCases.md` with any new test cases discovered during implementation.
  - [ ] Ensure the `README.md` and `docs/api/API_Documentation.md` are consistent.
- [ ] **Pull Request**:
  - [ ] Create a pull request for the `Stage5` branch.

## Recommendations

### Code Quality and Security

1.  **Stricter DTO Validation**: The `create-assessor.dto.ts` uses `z.discriminatedUnion` which is good, but the validation for the `IMAGE` task type could be more robust. The current implementation allows for a mix of `string` and `Buffer` types for the `reference`, `template`, and `studentResponse` fields. This could lead to unexpected behaviour. It is recommended to enforce that all three fields are of the same type. (Done in commit e736597)

2.  **E2E Test Assertions**: The E2E tests in `test/assessor.e2e-spec.ts` use `expect(true).toBe(true)` as a placeholder assertion. This has been replaced with more meaningful assertions that check the response body and status code. (Done)

3.  **Smoke Test Script**: The `scripts/verify-assessor.ts` script uses `console.warn` for both success and failure messages. This has been changed to use `console.log` for success and `console.error` for failure to provide a clearer output. Additionally, the script now exits with a non-zero exit code on failure to properly signal issues in an automated environment. (Done)

### Documentation

1.  **JSDoc Comments**: While JSDoc comments are present, they could be more detailed. For example, the `@returns` tag in `assessor.service.ts` could describe the shape of the returned object. This has been updated to provide a more detailed description of the returned object. (Done)

2.  **Consistency**: There are minor inconsistencies between the `README.md` and `docs/api/API_Documentation.md` regarding the example payload. These have been aligned. (Done)

## Conclusion

Stage 5 is a solid piece of work that lays a good foundation for the Assessor feature. By addressing the outstanding tasks and recommendations in this review, the implementation can be brought up to the high standards of the project.
