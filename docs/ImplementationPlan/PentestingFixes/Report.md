### Summary of Test Failures

Based on my analysis of the test results and the code in `test/pentesting.e2e-spec.ts`, I have grouped the 10 failing tests into two categories:

1.  **Faulty Assertions**: Tests that are failing due to issues within the test itself (e.g., incorrect assertions), not because of a problem in the application code.
2.  **Real Issues**: Tests that have correctly identified a bug, security vulnerability, or misconfiguration in the application that needs to be fixed.

### 1. Faulty Assertions (Needs Test Fixes)

The application is behaving correctly in these scenarios, but the tests are written in a way that causes them to fail.

| Test Name                                                   | Failure                                                                                    | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`should reject advanced NoSQL injection attempts`**       | The test fails to find the substring `"Expected string, received object"` in the response. | The application correctly returns a `400 Bad Request` with a validation error. The test assertion is too brittle; it stringifies the entire error object array and searches for a substring. The error message is slightly different from what the test expects (`"Invalid input: expected string, received object"`). The test should be updated to check the error message more robustly. |
| **`should not leak detailed error messages in production`** | The test expects a detailed error message but receives a generic `"Invalid input"`.        | This is the correct and secure behaviour for a production environment. The application is correctly hiding implementation details. The test assertion is wrong and should be updated to expect the generic error message.                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 2. Real Issues (Needs Code Fixes)

These tests have uncovered genuine problems in the application that require investigation and code changes to resolve.

| Test Name                                                          | Failure                                                                                             | Analysis & Potential Cause                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`should not allow CORS from arbitrary origins`**                 | Expected `204 No Content` for a preflight `OPTIONS` request, but got `404 Not Found`.               | This indicates the application's CORS policy is not configured correctly. The server should respond to preflight requests successfully. This is likely a misconfiguration in `main.ts`.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **`should reject requests with a malformed Bearer scheme`**        | Expected `401 Unauthorized` but got `201 Created`.                                                  | The authentication guard is not strictly enforcing the Bearer token format (e.g., it allows lowercase `bearer` or no space). This is a security flaw in the `api-key.strategy.ts` or `api-key.guard.ts`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **`should reject requests with API key in query parameters`**      | The test fails because the request is not rejected with a `401`.                                    | The application should not allow authentication credentials to be passed in a URL. The auth system must be hardened to only accept the `Authorization` header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **`should reject requests with API key in the body`**              | The test fails because the request is not rejected with a `401`.                                    | Similar to the above, placing API keys in the request body is an insecure practice that the application is currently allowing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **`should handle prototype pollution attempts gracefully`**        | Expected `400 Bad Request` but got `201 Created`.                                                   | This is a critical vulnerability. The application is not sanitising input correctly, allowing a malicious `__proto__` property to be processed. The `ZodValidationPipe` is likely not configured to prevent this.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **`should handle massive string payloads without crashing (DoS)`** | Expected `413 Payload Too Large` but got `500 Internal Server Error`.                               | The application is not gracefully handling requests that exceed the body size limit, leading to a server crash. The body parser limit and error handling in `main.ts` need to be correctly configured.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`should handle path traversal attempts safely`**                 | The test fails because a `GET` request with path traversal characters is not rejected with a `404`. | This is a potential security risk. While NestJS has built-in protection, this failure suggests a misconfiguration might be exposing the application to directory traversal attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`should reject payloads with NoSQL injection attempts`**         | The test fails to find the substring `"Expected string, received object"` in the response.          | Similar to the "advanced" NoSQL test, the application is correctly returning a `400` error, but the test assertion is too specific and failing. While the application's response is correct, the test's expectation for the _exact_ error message string is what is causing the failure. This is a faulty assertion but highlights that error messages might be inconsistent. |
