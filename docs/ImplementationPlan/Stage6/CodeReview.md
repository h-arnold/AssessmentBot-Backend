# Code Review

This code review was conducted after the completion of Stage 6 of the implementation plan.

## Overall Impression

The codebase is well-structured, following the principles of modularity and separation of concerns. The use of NestJS provides a solid foundation, and the integration of Zod for validation and Passport.js for authentication is well-executed. The new LLM and Prompt abstractions are a significant improvement, making the application more flexible and extensible.

## Specific Feedback

### `src/common/zod-validation.pipe.ts`

- **Strength**: The use of `safeParse` is a good improvement, as it allows for the collection of all validation errors, rather than stopping at the first one.
- **Suggestion**: The error message formatting could be more detailed. While the current implementation is functional, providing more context in the error messages would be beneficial for debugging.

### `src/llm/gemini.service.ts`

- **Strength**: The service is well-implemented, with good error handling and response validation. The use of `json-repair` is a nice touch, making the service more resilient to malformed JSON responses from the LLM.
- **Suggestion**: The `send` method could be made more generic to handle different types of payloads. Currently, it is tightly coupled to the `LlmResponseSchema`, which might not be ideal if the application needs to support other LLM response formats in the future.

### `src/prompt/prompt.factory.ts`

- **Strength**: The factory pattern is well-implemented, providing a clean and extensible way to create different types of prompts.
- **Suggestion**: The factory could be made more dynamic by using a map or a similar data structure to register the prompt types, rather than a hard-coded `switch` statement. This would make it easier to add new prompt types without modifying the factory itself.

### `src/v1/assessor/assessor.service.ts`

- **Strength**: The service is well-refactored, using the new `PromptFactory` and `LLMService` to handle the assessment logic. The code is clean and easy to follow.
- **Suggestion**: The service could benefit from more detailed logging. While the current logging is adequate, adding more log statements would make it easier to trace the execution flow and debug issues.

## Conclusion

Overall, the codebase is in good shape. The new abstractions for LLM and prompt generation are a significant improvement, and the code is well-structured and easy to maintain. The suggestions above are minor and can be addressed in future iterations.
