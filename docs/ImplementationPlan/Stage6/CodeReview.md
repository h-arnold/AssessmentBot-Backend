# Stage 6 Code Review

This document contains the code review for the work completed in Stage 6. The review focuses on code quality, test coverage, adherence to design patterns, and identification of potential issues or code smells.

**Overall Impression:** The implementation is of a high standard. The use of abstraction for the `LLMService` and a factory pattern for prompt generation has significantly improved the modularity and testability of the core assessment logic. The code is clean, well-structured, and the use of Zod for validation at multiple layers is excellent.

The following points are detailed observations and recommendations for refinement.

---

## 1. `llm` Module

### 1.1. `gemini.service.ts`

- **Observation:** The service hardcodes the model names (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest` and `gemini-pro-vision`). While acceptable for the current implementation, this could be more flexible.
- **Recommendation (Low Priority):** Consider moving the model names to the `ConfigService` to allow for easier updates and configuration without code changes.

- **Observation:** The `send` method's logic for differentiating between text and multimodal payloads relies on `typeof payload === 'string'`. This is slightly brittle.
- **Recommendation (Low Priority):** For future enhancements, consider a more explicit approach, such as a different method signature (e.g., `sendText` and `sendMultimodal`) or a payload object with a type property. This would make the contract between the `AssessorService` and `LLMService` more robust.

### 1.2. `llm/types.ts`

- **Observation:** The Zod schemas are well-defined and correctly enforce the structure of the LLM response. The use of `z.infer` to create the TypeScript type is a best practice.
- **Verdict:** Excellent. No issues found.

## 2. `prompt` Module

### 2.1. `prompt.base.ts`

- **Observation:** The `readMarkdown` method correctly resolves paths from the `src` directory, which is an improvement over the initial design that mentioned the `dist` folder. This removes the dependency on a build step for locating assets during testing and development.
- **Verdict:** Excellent. This is a positive deviation from the design.

- **Observation:** The `buildMessage` method now returns a structure with `system` and `user` properties. This was a necessary refinement to work correctly with the Gemini API and was well-documented in the `TODO.md` notes.
- **Verdict:** Good adaptation to API requirements.

### 2.2. `image.prompt.ts`

- **Observation:** The `buildMessage` method uses `Promise.all` to read multiple image files concurrently, which is efficient. The error handling is implicitly handled by the surrounding `try...catch` in the `AssessorService`, which is acceptable.
- **Verdict:** Good. No issues found.

### 2.3. `prompt.factory.ts`

- **Observation:** The factory is clean, simple, and correctly uses the `taskType` from the DTO to instantiate the appropriate prompt class. The error handling for unsupported types is correct.
- **Verdict:** Excellent. No issues found.

---

## 3. `assessor` Module

### 3.1. `assessor.service.ts`

- **Observation:** The `createAssessment` method is a model of clarity. It perfectly orchestrates the interaction between the factory and the LLM service. The logic is easy to follow and directly reflects the intended design.
- **Verdict:** Excellent.

### 3.2. `assessor.service.spec.ts`

- **Observation (Needs Action):** As noted in the `TODO.md`, there is a gap in test coverage. The tests currently only validate the scenario where `prompt.buildMessage()` returns a string-based payload. There is no test case to verify that the `AssessorService` correctly handles the object-based payload returned by `ImagePrompt` and passes it to `llmService.send`.
- **Recommendation (High Priority):** Add a new test case to `assessor.service.spec.ts`. This test should:
  1. Mock the `PromptFactory` to return a mock `ImagePrompt`.
  2. Mock the `buildMessage` method of the `ImagePrompt` to return a structured multimodal payload (e.g., `{ system: '...', user: [...] }`).
  3. Assert that `llmService.send` is called with this exact structured payload.

### 3.3. `dto/create-assessor.dto.ts`

- **Observation:** The use of `z.discriminatedUnion` is a robust and effective way to handle the different task types and their specific validation rules. The schemas are comprehensive.
- **Verdict:** Excellent.

## 4. General Observations

### 4.1. Documentation

- **Observation (Needs Action):** While the code is generally very clear, there is a lack of JSDoc comments on public methods and classes, particularly in the new `llm` and `prompt` modules. The `TODO.md` specifically calls for this.
- **Recommendation (Medium Priority):** Add JSDoc comments to all new public classes and methods (`GeminiService`, `PromptFactory`, `TextPrompt`, etc.) to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values. This is crucial for long-term maintainability.

### 4.2. Adherence to Standards

- **Observation:** The codebase consistently uses British English as required by `GEMINI.md`.
- **Verdict:** Excellent.

---

## Summary of Actionable Items

1.  **High Priority:** Add a test case to `assessor.service.spec.ts` to cover multimodal payloads.
2.  **Medium Priority:** Add JSDoc comments to the new classes and methods in the `llm` and `prompt` modules.
