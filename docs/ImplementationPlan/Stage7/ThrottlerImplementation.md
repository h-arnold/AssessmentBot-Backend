## NestJS Throttler Docs

```
Rate Limiting

A common technique to protect applications from brute-force attacks is rate-limiting. To get started, you'll need to install the @nestjs/throttler package.


$ npm i --save @nestjs/throttler

Once the installation is complete, the ThrottlerModule can be configured as any other Nest package with forRoot or forRootAsync methods.
app.module.ts
JS


@Module({
  imports: [
     ThrottlerModule.forRoot({
      throttlers: [
        {
          ttl: 60000,
          limit: 10,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

The above will set the global options for the ttl, the time to live in milliseconds, and the limit, the maximum number of requests within the ttl, for the routes of your application that are guarded.

Once the module has been imported, you can then choose how you would like to bind the ThrottlerGuard. Any kind of binding as mentioned in the guards section is fine. If you wanted to bind the guard globally, for example, you could do so by adding this provider to any module:


{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useClass: ThrottlerGuard
}

Multiple Throttler Definitions#

There may come upon times where you want to set up multiple throttling definitions, like no more than 3 calls in a second, 20 calls in 10 seconds, and 100 calls in a minute. To do so, you can set up your definitions in the array with named options, that can later be referenced in the @SkipThrottle() and @Throttle() decorators to change the options again.
app.module.ts
JS


@Module({
  imports: [
    ThrottlerModule.forRoot([
      {
        name: 'short',
        ttl: 1000,
        limit: 3,
      },
      {
        name: 'medium',
        ttl: 10000,
        limit: 20
      },
      {
        name: 'long',
        ttl: 60000,
        limit: 100
      }
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

Customization#

There may be a time where you want to bind the guard to a controller or globally, but want to disable rate limiting for one or more of your endpoints. For that, you can use the @SkipThrottle() decorator, to negate the throttler for an entire class or a single route. The @SkipThrottle() decorator can also take in an object of string keys with boolean values for if there is a case where you want to exclude most of a controller, but not every route, and configure it per throttler set if you have more than one. If you do not pass an object, the default is to use { default: true }


@SkipThrottle()
@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {}

This @SkipThrottle() decorator can be used to skip a route or a class or to negate the skipping of a route in a class that is skipped.


@SkipThrottle()
@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  // Rate limiting is applied to this route.
  @SkipThrottle({ default: false })
  dontSkip() {
    return 'List users work with Rate limiting.';
  }
  // This route will skip rate limiting.
  doSkip() {
    return 'List users work without Rate limiting.';
  }
}

There is also the @Throttle() decorator which can be used to override the limit and ttl set in the global module, to give tighter or looser security options. This decorator can be used on a class or a function as well. With version 5 and onwards, the decorator takes in an object with the string relating to the name of the throttler set, and an object with the limit and ttl keys and integer values, similar to the options passed to the root module. If you do not have a name set in your original options, use the string default. You have to configure it like this:


// Override default configuration for Rate limiting and duration.
@Throttle({ default: { limit: 3, ttl: 60000 } })
@Get()
findAll() {
  return "List users works with custom rate limiting.";
}
```

## Task

Using the provided log ouput and test data, can you form a hypothesis about the throttler's behavior and the test failures? Please examine all the files you need to establish a clear understanding of the throttler's implementation and the test cases.
