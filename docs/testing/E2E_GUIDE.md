# E2E Testing Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up and running the End-to-End (E2E) tests for the AssessmentBot-Backend.

## Running E2E Tests

E2E tests are split into mocked (default) and live suites. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Default mocked suite (no live Gemini calls)
npm run test:e2e

# Explicit mocked run
npm run test:e2e:mocked

# Live suite (real Gemini API calls)
npm run test:e2e:live
```

The mocked run builds the application and executes all `*.e2e-spec.ts` tests in the `test/` directory **excluding** `*-live.e2e-spec.ts`. The live run targets `assessor-live.e2e-spec.ts` only.

### Mocked vs Live Configuration

- **Mocked config**: `jest-e2e.mocked.config.cjs` sets `E2E_MOCK_LLM=true` via `test/jest.e2e.mocked.setup.ts` and ignores `*-live.e2e-spec.ts`.
- **Live config**: `jest-e2e.live.config.cjs` sets `E2E_MOCK_LLM=false` via `test/jest.e2e.live.setup.ts` and runs `assessor-live.e2e-spec.ts`.

## Test Environment

E2E tests are managed by utilities in `test/utils/` to ensure each test file runs against a fresh, isolated application instance.

### Cache E2E Tests

The assessor cache suites (`test/assessor-cache.e2e-spec.ts`) include TTL and eviction scenarios that wait 60–75 seconds per case. Expect the full E2E run to take several minutes when these tests are included.

These tests also rely on LLM dispatch log messages (`Dispatching LLM request`) to count cache hits and misses. If the log message changes, update the log watcher expectations in `test/utils/log-watcher.ts` and the cache E2E suite.

### Environment Configuration

The test setup uses a specific strategy for managing environment variables to ensure reliability and security:

1.  **Hardcoded Test Configuration**: Most configuration variables (`PORT`, `API_KEYS`, `THROTTLER_TTL`, etc.) are hardcoded within the `startApp` function in `test/utils/app-lifecycle.ts`. This guarantees that all tests run with the exact same configuration, simplifying setup and preventing flaky tests.

2.  **Live API Key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)**: The `GEMINI_API_KEY` is a sensitive secret and is handled differently:
    - **Default**: A dummy key (`dummy-key-for-testing`) is injected by default. This allows mocked E2E tests to run without any special setup.
    - **Live Tests**: To run the live test (`assessor-live.e2e-spec.ts`), which makes real calls to the Gemini API, you **must** provide a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Create a file named `.test.env` in the project's root directory and add the following:

      ```
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here
      ```

    The `startApp` function automatically detects this file and uses the key if it exists. This is the **only** recommended use for the `.test.env` file.

3.  **API Rate Limiting Configuration**: To prevent hitting Google Gemini API rate limits (especially on the free tier), the test environment includes enhanced retry and backoff settings:
    - `LLM_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`: Set to `2000` (2 seconds) in test environment, doubled from the production default of 1 second
    - `LLM_MAX_RETRIES`: Set to `5` in test environment, increased from the production default of 3
    - Tests include strategic delays between API calls to stay within rate limits:
      - Most tests that call the Gemini API include a 2-second delay before making requests
      - The throttler test uses sequential requests with 600ms delays instead of parallel requests
      - Live API tests include 2-second delays between each test case

    These settings are automatically applied when tests run and help ensure consistent test execution without rate limit errors.

### HTTP Shim Behaviour (Mocked E2E)

When `E2E_MOCK_LLM=true`, the test runner enables an HTTP shim to avoid live Gemini calls:

- `startApp` injects `--require "test/utils/llm-http-shim.cjs"` via `NODE_OPTIONS`.
- The shim monkey-patches `@google/generative-ai` by overriding `GoogleGenerativeAI.prototype.getGenerativeModel`.
- `generateContent` returns a deterministic JSON payload with fixed scores (all `3`) and short reasoning text.

This keeps the full HTTP request/response flow intact while making LLM responses stable and offline. Use the live suite when you need to validate real Gemini behaviour or quotas.

### Overriding Environment Variables

For specific scenarios, such as testing throttler limits, you can override the default environment variables by passing an `envOverrides` object to the `startApp` function.

**Example:**

```typescript
describe('Throttler E2E Test', () => {
  let app: AppInstance;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const envOverrides = {
      AUTHENTICATED_THROTTLER_LIMIT: '5', // Override default
      THROTTLER_TTL: '10',
    };
    app = await startApp('/tmp/throttler-test.log', envOverrides);
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    stopApp(app.appProcess);
  });

  it('should block requests after reaching the limit', async () => {
    // ... test logic
  });
});
```

## How to Add a New E2E Test

1.  Create a new file in the `test/` directory with the suffix `.e2e-spec.ts` (e.g., `my-feature.e2e-spec.ts`).
2.  Import `startApp` and `stopApp` from `./utils/app-lifecycle.ts`.
3.  Use `beforeAll` to call `startApp`. Pass an `envOverrides` object if needed.
4.  Use `afterAll` to call `stopApp` to terminate the application process.
5.  Write your tests using `supertest` to make requests to the `appUrl` provided by the `startApp` result.
6.  **Important**: If your test makes calls to the Gemini API, import and use the `delay()` helper function to add a 2-second delay before API calls to avoid rate limiting:

```typescript
import { startApp, stopApp, delay } from './utils/app-lifecycle';

it('should assess a submission', async () => {
  await delay(2000); // Add delay before API call

  const response = await request(app.appUrl)
    .post('/v1/assessor')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${app.apiKey}`)
    .send(payload);

  expect(response.status).toBe(201);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting Errors (503 Service Unavailable)

If you encounter 503 errors or "Resource Exhausted" messages when running E2E tests:

1.  **Check API Key Tier**: The free tier of the Google Gemini API has stricter rate limits. If tests consistently fail with rate limit errors, you may need to:
    - Use a paid API key with higher limits
    - Increase the delays between API calls in your tests
    - Run tests individually rather than the full suite

2.  **Verify Delay Configuration**: Ensure tests that call the Gemini API include appropriate delays:
    - Standard tests: 2-second delay before API calls using `await delay(2000)`
    - Throttler tests: 600ms delays between sequential requests
    - Live API tests: 2-second delays between test cases

3.  **Check Retry Settings**: The test environment automatically configures enhanced retry settings:
    - `LLM_BACKOFF_BASE_MS=2000` (2 seconds)
    - `LLM_MAX_RETRIES=5`

    These are set in `test/utils/app-lifecycle.ts` and the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

4.  **Run Tests Individually**: If the full suite fails due to rate limits, run individual test files:

    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e:mocked -- test/auth.e2e-spec.ts
    npm run test:e2e:live -- test/assessor-live.e2e-spec.ts
    ```

5.  **Monitor API Usage**: Check your Gemini API quota and usage in the Google Cloud Console to ensure you haven't exceeded limits.
