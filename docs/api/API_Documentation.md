# API Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Assessment Bot Backend API, detailing available endpoints, authentication methods, and data structures.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is `http://localhost:3000` when running locally.

## Authentication

Currently, authentication details are not yet implemented. This section will be updated once authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth) are in place.

## Endpoints

### Health Check

The health check endpoint provides information about the application's status.

- **URL:** `/health`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Returns the current status of the application, including its name, version, and a timestamp.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "applicationName": "Assessment Bot Backend",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-07T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
  _(Note: The `timestamp` will reflect the actual time of the request, and `applicationName` and `version` are retrieved dynamically from `package.json`.)_

## Error Handling

Details on error handling and common error codes will be provided here as the API develops.
