# Authentication & Authorisation

This document provides a detailed technical breakdown of the authentication and authorisation mechanism implemented in the AssessmentBot-Backend.

## Overview

The system uses a stateless API key authentication model. All protected endpoints require a valid API key to be passed in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` token scheme. The entire authentication process is handled by the `AuthModule`.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication process for a protected endpoint follows these steps:

    participant Client
    participant Controller
    participant ApiKeyGuard
    participant ApiKeyStrategy
    participant ApiKeyService

    Client->>+Controller: Request with "Authorization: Bearer <key>"
    Controller->>+ApiKeyGuard: Intercepts Request
    ApiKeyGuard->>+ApiKeyStrategy: Invokes 'bearer' strategy
    ApiKeyStrategy->>ApiKeyStrategy: Validate "Bearer " scheme
    alt Malformed Scheme
        ApiKeyStrategy-->>-Controller: Throws UnauthorizedException
    else Correct Scheme
        ApiKeyStrategy->>+ApiKeyService: validate(key)
        ApiKeyService->>ApiKeyService: 1. Zod Schema Check (format, length)
        ApiKeyService->>ApiKeyService: 2. Check if key exists in configured list
        alt Invalid Key
            ApiKeyService-->>-ApiKeyStrategy: Throws UnauthorizedException
        else Valid Key
            ApiKeyService-->>-ApiKeyStrategy: Returns User object
        end
        ApiKeyStrategy-->>-ApiKeyGuard: Returns User object
    end
    ApiKeyGuard-->>-Controller: Attaches User to Request
    Controller-->>-Client: Access Granted & Processes Request
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1.  **Request Initiation**: A client sends a request to a protected endpoint, including the `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header.
2.  **Guard Interception**: The `ApiKeyGuard`, applied to the controller or endpoint, intercepts the incoming request.
3.  **Strategy Invocation**: The guard invokes the Passport.js `bearer` strategy, which is implemented by our `ApiKeyStrategy`.
4.  **Scheme Validation**: `ApiKeyStrategy` first performs a strict check on the `Authorization` header to ensure it starts with `Bearer ` (case-sensitive, with a trailing space). If not, it immediately throws an `UnauthorizedException` to reject malformed requests.
5.  **Service Delegation**: If the scheme is valid, the strategy passes the extracted API key to the `ApiKeyService.validate()` method.
6.  **Key Validation**: The `ApiKeyService` performs two validation steps:
    a. **Format Validation**: It uses a Zod schema (`z.string().min(10).regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/)`) to ensure the key meets the required format (at least 10 characters, alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores). This prevents unnecessary checks on malformed keys.
    b. **Existence Check**: If the format is valid, it checks if the key is present in the list of `API_KEYS` loaded from the `ConfigService`.
7.  **Outcome**:
    - If the key is invalid in either step, an `UnauthorizedException` is thrown.
    - If the key is valid, the service returns a `User` object (e.g., `{ apiKey: 'the-valid-key' }`).
8.  **Context Attachment**: The `User` object is passed back up the chain, and Passport attaches it to the `Request` object, making it available within the controller.

## Security Implementation Details

### Strict Bearer Scheme Enforcement

File: `src/auth/api-key.strategy.ts`

The strategy explicitly checks `authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')`. This is a security enhancement to prevent ambiguity and enforce the RFC 6750 standard correctly. It helps avoid accepting non-compliant headers like `bearer <token>` or `Bearer<token>`.

### Comprehensive Key Validation

File: `src/auth/api-key.service.ts`

The use of a Zod schema for initial validation is a defense-in-depth measure. It allows the system to fail fast for clearly invalid tokens before performing a search in the list of valid keys, which is a slightly more expensive operation.

### Configuration

API keys are managed centrally via the `API_KEYS` environment variable. This variable should contain a comma-separated list of valid keys. The `ConfigService` is responsible for parsing this string into an array for the `ApiKeyService` to use.
