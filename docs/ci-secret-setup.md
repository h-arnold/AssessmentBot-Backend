# GEMINI_API_KEY Secret Setup for CI/CD

This repository requires the `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret to be configured for CI/CD workflows to pass.

## Issue Identified

The CI workflow is failing because the `GEMINI_API_KEY` GitHub repository secret is either:

1. Not set in the repository settings
2. Empty/invalid
3. Not accessible to the workflow

## Solution

The repository owner needs to:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"

2. **Add the GEMINI_API_KEY Secret**:
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your valid Google Gemini API key
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Verify the Secret**:
   - The secret should appear in the list of repository secrets
   - It should show as "Updated" with a recent timestamp

## Testing

After adding the secret:

1. Re-run the failed CI workflow
2. The validation step should now pass with "GEMINI_API_KEY secret is available"
3. E2E tests should run successfully

## Security Notes

- The secret is only accessible to GitHub Actions workflows
- It will not be visible in logs or to unauthorized users
- The validation steps do not expose the secret content
