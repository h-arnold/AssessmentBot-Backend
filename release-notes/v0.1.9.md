# Release v0.1.9 (draft)

Release highlights

- Patch release: Bumped package version to v0.1.9.
- Security & privacy fix: avoid logging potentially sensitive LLM-repaired JSON in production.
- Gemini model and tooling: update Gemini model version and add a thinking-budget parameter; add Java support for SonarQube in the development container.

## Details

### Security & bug fixes

- **Fix PII leak in JSON repair logging** (#134) — Changed repaired JSON logging from `logger.log()` to `logger.debug()` so repaired LLM responses are not emitted at INFO in production environments. Added a unit test to verify debug-level logging for repaired JSON.

  Files changed (not exhaustive):
  - `src/common/json-parser.util.ts` — use `logger.debug()` for repaired JSON
  - `src/common/json-parser.util.spec.ts` — added test for debug logging

### Improvements

- **Gemini model updates and configuration** (#135) — Update Gemini model to version 2.5 and introduce a `thinking budget` parameter to control model "thinking" behaviour. This change allows finer-grained control of LLM internal behaviour and prepares for disabling or tuning the thinking step by default.

- **Development environment** (#135) — Add Java support in the development container to support SonarQube analysis tooling.

## Upgrade notes

- No breaking API changes are included in this release.
- Production operators: ensure `LOG_LEVEL` remains at `info` (the default) or higher unless debugging is required; repaired JSON will now be visible only when `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
- If you rely on Gemini-specific behaviour, review `llm` configuration for the new thinking-budget parameter and updated model version.
