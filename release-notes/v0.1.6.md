# Release v0.1.6 (draft)

Release highlights

- Improved prompt consistency and scoring clarity across image, table, and text templates.
- Fixed Gemini model selection logic to choose models based on payload type.
- Ensured image processing includes studentTask context and improved image prompt clarity.
- Developer experience: devcontainer and task updates for easier remote development (port forwarding, server binding).
- Assessor creation now validates templates to prevent malformed templates at runtime.
- Bumped package version to v0.1.6.

## Details

### Prompts & templates

- Standardised the "Your Role" section across image, table, and text prompts for consistent instruction delivery.
- Clarified scoring criteria and role descriptions to improve evaluation consistency.

### LLM / Gemini

- Updated model selection logic in Gemini integration to select the proper model variant depending on the payload type sent to the Gemini API, improving reliability of model calls.

### Image processing

- Fixed an issue where `studentTask` was missing from image processing prompts, ensuring the LLM has the correct task context.

### Developer & tooling

- Updated devcontainer configuration to forward port 3000 and notify on auto-forward.
- Updated VS Code tasks to run the dev server in the foreground and grouped tasks properly.
- Changed server binding to listen on all interfaces (useful for remote containers and dev environments).

## Upgrade notes

- No breaking API changes detected from the commit messages. Still, if you depend on typed behaviour from the LLM integration, test any custom flows relying on model selection logic.
- If you run the devcontainer or use remote containers, the forwarded port and binding changes should help — you may want to re-open or rebuild the devcontainer to pick up the `.devcontainer` change.
