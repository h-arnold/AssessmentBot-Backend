# Release v0.1.10 (draft)

Release highlights

- Patch release: Bumped package version to v0.1.10.
- Codex delegation streaming: added concise streamed output with turn events, commands, file changes, tool calls, and web searches.
- Delegate runner reliability: hardened event parsing/validation, improved formatting, and clarified documentation for sub-agents.
- Documentation: added delegation streaming guidance and linked it from the docs index and README.

## Details

### Developer tooling

- **Codex delegation streaming** — Added a streamed output emitter and formatter for delegate runs, with caps on emitted items and optional verbose logging to file. New unit tests cover formatter/output behaviour.

- **Delegate runner resilience** — Hardened event parsing for optional payload fields and improved turn summary formatting for streamed output.

- **Documentation updates** — Expanded delegation guidance and linked it from the main README and docs index.

## Upgrade notes

- No breaking API changes detected in this release.
- Delegation output now streams concise summaries; use `--max-items` to cap entries or `--verbose` to log full event payloads.
