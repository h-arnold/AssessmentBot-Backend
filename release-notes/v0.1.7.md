## Details

### Prompts & templates

- Improved clarity of scoring criteria and assessment instructions (completeness & accuracy) across system prompts. Several fixes refined wording so evaluators and LLM scoring are more consistent.
- Specific improvements were made to image-related prompts to ensure the LLM receives clear assessment criteria.

### Packaging & dependencies

- Bumped package version to v0.1.7 (see package.json / package-lock.json updates).
- Updated Node dependencies to the latest compatible versions to address maintenance and security updates.

## Upgrade notes

- No breaking API changes detected in this set of commits. Consumers should nonetheless test any flow that relies on specific prompt wording or scoring behavior.
- If you manage deployments or lockfiles, consider reviewing the dependency updates (package-lock.json) and re-installing with a clean install if you pin exact versions.
