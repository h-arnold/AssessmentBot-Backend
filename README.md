## Introduction

Welcome to the backend for the Assessment Bot project. This repository contains a stateless, NestJS-based API responsible for receiving assessment tasks, interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM) for evaluation, and returning a structured grade.

This service is the backend component of a larger system. The primary business logic and user interface are managed by the frontend, available at: **[h-arnold/AssessmentBot](https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot)**.

This README provides a quick start guide and a high-level overview. For detailed information on architecture, development, and API usage, please refer to our comprehensive **[documentation](./docs/README.md)**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Stateless Design**: No user data or session information is stored on the server, ensuring privacy and scalability.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with NestJS, following SOLID principles for a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
- **LLM Integration**: Abstracted service layer for interacting with LLMs (currently Google's Gemini) to perform assessments.
- **Robust Validation**: All inputs are strictly validated using Zod for enhanced security and type safety.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Adheres to Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a full suite of unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- **Containerised**: Ships with Docker and Docker Compose configurations for easy development and production deployment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

You can get the backend running locally using either Docker Compose (recommended for a full environment) or Node.js directly.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 22.x
- **Docker**: Docker Engine and Docker Compose
- **Git**

### 1. Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method starts the application along with a Caddy reverse proxy and Fail2ban for security.

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot-Backend.git
    cd AssessmentBot-Backend
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Copy the example environment file. You must provide a `GEMINI_API_KEY` and at least one `API_KEYS` for the application to be functional.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open `.env` in your editor and add your keys.

3.  **Start the services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:80`. For more details, see the [Docker Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment/docker.md).

### 2. Using Node.js

1.  **Clone and install**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot-Backend.git
    cd AssessmentBot-Backend
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables**:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY and API_KEYS
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**:
    `bash
    npm run start:dev
    `
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîå API Overview

The backend exposes a simple REST API. The primary endpoint is used to submit tasks for assessment.

- **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/assessor`
- **Authentication**: `Bearer` token (API Key)
- **Body**: A JSON payload containing the task type, reference solution, template, and the student's response.

For a complete reference including request/response schemas, error codes, and rate limiting, please see the **[API Documentation](./docs/api/API_Documentation.md)**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built using a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns between controllers, services, and integration points.
