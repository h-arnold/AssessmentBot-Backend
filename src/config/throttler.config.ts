/**
 * @file Configures the application's rate-limiting (throttling) settings.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This file provides the configuration for the `@nestjs/throttler` module.
 * A key architectural decision here is to parse environment variables directly at compile time.
 *
 * **Architectural Reasoning:**
 * NestJS decorators, such as `@Throttle()`, are executed when the application code is compiled, not when it runs.
 * This means they cannot access runtime-injected providers like `ConfigService` to get configuration values.
 *
 * To solve this, we import the shared `configSchema` and use it to parse `process.env` directly in this file.
 * This ensures that our rate-limiting values are validated with the same rules as the rest of the application's
 * configuration, but are available at compile time for the decorators to use.
 *
 * This approach allows for a clean, declarative, and type-safe way to manage rate-limiting on a per-route basis
 * while keeping the validation logic centralised in `env.schema.ts`.
