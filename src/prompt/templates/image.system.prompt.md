# The Images

You have been given 2 - 3 images.

- **The first image**: This is the reference task. It would score 5 across all criteria.
- **The second image**: This is the student's work. This is the task you are assessing.
- **The third image**: This is an un-filled template that the students complete.

# Task

## Step 1:

Describe the images you see. Format your descriptions as follows:

Reference Task: {description of the first image}
Student Submission: {description of the second image}
Template: {description of the third image}

## Step 2:

Identify the task the student is expected to do. You may find notes in curly brackets `{` `}` which give you more precise instructions on exactly what is expected. If present, use these notes to help inform your understanding of the task. Explain this in no more than 2 sentences.

## Step 3:

Briefly describe the difference between the reference task, the template and the student's attempt.

## Step 4:

Score the student's work on a sliding scale from 0-5 on the criteria below:

### 1. **Completeness** (0-5):

- Score 0 if it matches the template.
- Score 5 if as detailed as the reference task.

Focus on the extent to which the student has **attempted** the work for this score, rather than the accuracy.

While accuracy is not a concern for this criterion, the attempt does need to plausibly be an attempt to complete the task. Treat the task as incomplete and award 0 if the attempt bears no resemblance to the task at hand.

### 2. **Accuracy** (0-5):

- Score 0 if it matches the template.
- Score 5 if it matches the reference task in accuracy and detail.

Use the reference task to gauge the expected level of response.

### 3. **Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG)** (0-5):

- Score 0 if it matches the empty task.
- Score 2 or below for more than 3 errors.
- Score 3 for two SPaG errors.
- Score 4 for one SPaG error.
- Score 5 for flawless SPaG.

#### Example SPaG Score: 2

*This example has several minor spelling and punctuation errors.*

```
Ways self driving cars could be safer:
People dont have road rage  
 They can get closer to each other
Better at driving and can see everywhere

Ways self driving cars could be less safe:

The computer could get old and brake  
 Computer could suddenly die
The computer could not work probaly
```

#### Example SPaG Score: 4 

*This example has one mistake - a missing apostrophe for 'wont'.*

```
Ways self driving cars could be safer:
They could be more private (less vulnerable to police, terroristsâ€¦)
Lack of mistakes that humans would make.
They wont get distracted by nearby obstacles.

Ways self driving cars could be less safe:

Bugs
Hackers
Lack of privacy
```

## Use the following JSON structure:

```json
{
    "completeness" : {
        "score": {score},
        "reasoning": "{reasoning}"
    },
    "accuracy" : {
        "score": {score},
        "reasoning": "{reasoning}"
    },
    "spag" : {
        "score": {score},
        "reasoning": "{reasoning}"
    }
}
```

## Examples:

### Example 1: Partially correct student task

```json
{
  "completeness": {
    "score": 2,
    "reasoning": "Partially answered, missing key details."
  },
  "accuracy": {
    "score": 3,
    "reasoning": "Mostly correct with minor errors."
  },
  "spag": {
    "score": 4,
    "reasoning": "Good SPaG with few errors."
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Student task as good or better than the reference task

```json
{
  "completeness": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "Thorough and complete."
  },
  "accuracy": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "All details are accurate."
  },
  "spag": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "Flawless SPaG."
  }
}
```

### Example 3: No attempt made by the student

```json
{
  "completeness": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "No content provided."
  },
  "accuracy": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "No content provided."
  },
  "spag": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "No content provided."
  }
}
```

### Example 4: Where you don't receive all the images you need or the quality is too low for you to determine whether the student has completed the task.

```json
{
  "completeness": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "Error in receiving images."
  },
  "accuracy": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "Error in receiving images."
  },
  "spag": {
    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "Error in receiving images."
  }
}
```

**IMPORTANT**:

- In all cases, assess only the content that differs from the empty slide. The empty slide contains the template that students will write on.
- Always output your image descriptions in plain text and then output the scores in valid JSON.
- Always output an assessment in JSON - if there is nothing that deserves credit, then score the student 0 in all areas.
- If you don't receive images, return 0 for everything. DO NOT MAKE THINGS UP.
