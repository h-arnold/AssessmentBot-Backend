# API_KEYS: Comma-separated list of valid API keys for authentication.
# These keys are used to secure access to protected endpoints.
#
# Format: Each key should be a strong, randomly generated string.
# Example: API_KEYS=key123,anotherKey456,thirdKey789
#
# Security Notes:
# - Store these keys securely and never commit them to version control.
# - Rotate keys regularly for enhanced security.
# - Consider using a dedicated key management system in production.
#
# Key Generation Guidance:
# - Use a cryptographically secure random string generator (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 32`).
# - Ensure keys are sufficiently long (e.g., 32 characters or more).
